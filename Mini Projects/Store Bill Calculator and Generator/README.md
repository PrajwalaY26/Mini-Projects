# Shopping Bill Calculator

Welcome to the Shopping Bill Calculator! This is a simple Python application designed to help you keep track of your shopping expenses.

## About

The application prompts the user to enter the price of each item they purchase. As they enter each price, the application calculates and displays the total cost of all items so far. When the user is done shopping, they can quit the application, and it will display the final total bill.

## How it Works

The script runs an infinite loop, where each iteration does the following:

1. Prompts the user to enter the price of an item or press 'q' to quit.
2. If the user enters a price, the script adds the price to the total sum and prints the current total.
3. If the user presses 'q', the script prints the final total bill and exits.

## Setup

To run this application, you need Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official site.

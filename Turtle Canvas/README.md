# Turtle Canvas

Welcome to the `Turtle Canvas` folder! This is a fun and creative space where I explore the possibilities of the `turtle` module in Python.

## About

The `turtle` module in Python is a great tool for creating graphics and drawing pictures. In this folder, I use `turtle` to create a variety of projects, from simple shapes to complex drawings. These projects are done purely for fun and to experiment with different drawing techniques.

## Projects

The `Turtle Canvas` folder contains a variety of drawing projects. Each project resides in its own directory and comes with its own README file that provides more information about the project.

## Setup

To run these projects, you need Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official site.

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository and run the scripts:

```bash
python script_name.py

Remember to replace script_name.py with the name of the Python script you want to run.

## Contributing

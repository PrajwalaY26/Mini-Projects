# RoboSpeaker 1.1

Welcome to the repository for "RoboSpeaker 1.1", a simple text-to-speech application created by me.

## About the Project

RoboSpeaker 1.1 is a simple Python-based application that converts text input into speech. It uses the `pyttsx3` library, which is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pyttsx3

You can install the `pyttsx3` library using pip:

```shell
pip install pyttsx3
```

## Usage

After cloning the repository and installing the prerequisites, you can run the script using Python:

```python main.py```

The script will prompt you to enter the text you want it to speak. You can stop the script by entering “q”.

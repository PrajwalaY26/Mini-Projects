# Projects

# Turtle Canvas
In this I have used the Turtle library and make some fun drawings!

1. *Rainbow*: A project that beautifully demonstrates the use of colors in Python.

2. *Panda*: In this you can see the code of how to draw a Panda using Python.

3. *Solar system* : This is the easiest, take a look at it!

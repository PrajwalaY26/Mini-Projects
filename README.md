# My Python Projects

This repository is a collection of Python projects that I am building. Each project is a testament to my journey in learning and mastering Python. Feel free to explore and provide feedback.

## Projects

1. *Rainbow*: A project that beautifully demonstrates the use of colors in Python.

2. *Panda*: In this you can see the code of how to draw a Panda using Python.

3. *Solar system* : This is the easiest, take a look at it!   

## Installation and Setup

You just need an IDLE and import the Turle and Pandas libraries. Here I have used Visual Studio Code, as its very comfortable and has a cool interface.

## Contributing
